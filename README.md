# Hunger Saver
This is a project for the Database Management course I took in Spring 2023. The system connects demanders and suppliers of surplus foodâ€”suppliers post listings, while demanders reserve items. By matching supply with demand, it fosters a circular economy. I specialized in UI design and development, using Java GUI.
